# WIP.. Check Back Soon!

# Thoughts:

I've opted to share the repo with you before I actually start working on the assessment because I believe giving you insight into how I work (commit code etc) provides significant value in addition to the answers themselves.

No obligation to actually view individual commits if you disagree with this sentiment, or simply do not have the time to do so.

Thanks,

~Mike
