First of all thank you for your interest in joining our team. We want to make sure that you are happy joining our team and comfortable in our environment.

In order to help with your upcoming interview, we have taken a tiny snippet of our codebase to show you some of our structure.

We are all developers here, and we understand that coding challenges can be intimidating and stressful. So we hope that our approach is easy and helpful at giving you a look at our code structure and gives you an ability to look over some of the concepts that we expect you to be familiar with.

You might not be familiar with them, you might have lots of questions and that is GREAT! We are not expecting you to know everything but to have a working knowledge and be able to learn what you do not understand.

We are also looking at hiring different tiers of developers. The best way for us to help you is to be honest about your current skills and understanding of the technology.

Please take a moment before your interview and follow these steps.

#1 Look over the code base and structure of this folder. Imagine this would be inside of the vendor folder from a composer project.

#2 There are several \TODO comments around the code. Take a moment to comment on what you think is going on there.

#3 In the app structure there is a Routes file, a Controller and a View. For extra points attempt to make a GET route, that points to a new controller that you make, to a method that displays a view you create. We know that is not a runnable environment so small typos are not going to be considered a negative.
